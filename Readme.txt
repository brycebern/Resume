This contains a compilation of my Computer Science projects.
ConnectFour.py is my Final Project from Intro to CS.  It is a culmination of my acquired skills in Python.
RecursiveLinkedList.py is an implementation of the List ADT.  It emphasizes my ability to use recursion in Java.
BernZunigaHW08 further demonstrates my aptitude with Java ADTs.  My partner and I implement a Stack using using a Linked list.  We implement a Queue using a circular array.  Finally, we write three short methods utilizing these implementations.
